        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>Bear Alarm™ enables ordinary people to protect their property and ensure the survival of bears in their native habitats<br><br><br></p>
        <h2 id="how">How We Do It</h2>
        <p>Powered by our patented Alarmingly Effective™ sound wave technology, Bear Alarm™ gives any person the power to protect themselves and their property, while helping endangered bears steer clear from harmful human contact.<br><br>Using specially coded micro-bits, the collars function as radio beacons that can be used by other devices for locating bears and minimizing their threat to humans. Each receiver is all-purpose, doing its job whether placed on trash cans, personal property, or worn on your person. <br><br>The detectors can reach up to 1000 feet, though the devices can be calibrated to achieve more precise distances less than 5 feet.<br><br><br></p>
        <h2 id="why">Our bears are going extinct</h2>
        <p>According to a study by the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bear.htm">National Park Service</a>, the amount of bears in the has gone down by 13% in the last 30 years, and are on track to reach a decrease of 15% by 2030.</p>
